Question 1:
Given a threshold value, the code continuously multiplies a multiplier value with a product value while incrementing the multiplier by one, until the product value exceeds the original threshold.


Question 2:
When a list of strings is passed into the function, it calculates the length and parity of each string and stores this information in a nested dictionary. A for loop is then used to print the key-value pairs line by line.


Question 3:
The file contains a function that takes two integers, x and y, as arguments and returns x raised to the power of y. This function is later used in a for loop that iterates through a list of pairs of integers, applying argument unpacking. Only pairs with non-negative exponents are processed.


Question 4:
After generating a random number x between 0 and 1 and a list of 20 random numbers between 0 and 1, the code sorts the list and identifies all numbers that are greater than or equal to x. Conditionals are then used to determine the first index in the original list where a value meets or exceeds x, if such a value exists.


Question 5:
After importing the math library, a function is defined that takes two arguments representing the radii of two circles. The areas of both circles are calculated using math.pi. Conditional statements determine which circle is larger. The area of the smaller circle is then divided by the area of the larger circle and multiplied by 100 to find the percentage of the larger circle covered by the smaller one.


Question 6:
The function takes a list of numbers and creates a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list. For each key, it calculates the percentage of elements in the list that are less than or equal to that number. The list is sorted first so the dictionary keys appear in order, and the resulting percentages are rounded to two decimal places before being stored.


Question 7:
The function takes a number of seconds and converts it into a formatted 12-hour clock time with AM or PM. It first validates that the input is a positive integer and reduces the total seconds to within a single day. The hours, minutes, and seconds are calculated by dividing and subtracting appropriately, with minutes and seconds formatted to always display two digits.


Question 8: 
The code creates a dictionary with three keys and corresponding lists of values, then converts it into a pandas data frame. A new column D is added to the data frame with specified values. Finally, the complete data frame, including the new column, is printed.
